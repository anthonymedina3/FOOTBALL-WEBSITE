            <h1>THE SUPERBOWL</h1>
            <p>The Super Bowl is the league championship game in the nfl. It has served as the final game of every NFL season since 1966. Since 2022 the game has been played on the second Sunday in February. Winning teams are awarded the Vince Lombardi Trophy named after the eponymous coach who won the first two Super Bowls. Because the NFL restricts the use of its Super Bowl trademark it is frequently referred to as the big game. The day the game is held is referred to as Super Bowl Sunday or Super Sunday. </p>
